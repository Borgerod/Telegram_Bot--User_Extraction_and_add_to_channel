## Project description
I made a Telegram bot that did two things.
- Scraper members fro any group, with the limitations that it can only scrape 4k members from each group.
- Also allows you to add those scraped members to any groups or channels, that you are admin of.

Whats special about this bot is that it add people to channels, which most most providers of telegram bots aren't able to do.
